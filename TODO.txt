Check TODO tag in source.

Otherwise:

- multi-byte queue
- multi-byte serial_send()
- monitor as first task ?

First user task: serial echo

1:  MOV AX,1  // serial get
	INT 80h
	MOV DX,AX
	MOV AX,2  // serial put
	INT 80h
	JMP 1B

How to save power ?

- cannot power down as T0 and serial needed, but can power save
- decrease main clock (impact timer T2 and serial port speed)
- disable DMA controller clock
- passive wait with HLT instruction

CPU frequency scaler:

- for power saving
- idle routine with load measurement
- main clock divisor chained to T2 and serial

Some experiments:

- serial x2 = baud x2 ?
- if confirmed, speed up the load/dump

New bootstrap with minimum setup for MON86:

- io port setup
- chip select setup
- T2 and T0 setup
- serial setup
