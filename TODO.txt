Short-term

- Add watchdog quiet
- Add serial TX interrupt
- Restore interrupt stack ?
- Test on SBC

How to save power ?

- cannot power down as T0 and serial needed, but can power save
- decrease main clock (impact timer T2 and serial port speed)
- disable timer T1 or use it for timer @ 1 ms resolution
- decrease rate of T2-T0 chain (T2 : 100 -> 5000 and T0 : 50000 -> 1000)
- disable DMA controller clock
- passive wait with HLT instruction

CPU frequency scaler:

- for power saving
- idle routine with load measurement
- main clock divisor chained to T2 and serial

Some experiments:

- serial x2 = baud x2 ?
- if confirmed, speed up the load/dump

New bootstrap with minimum setup for MON86:

- io port setup
- chip select setup
- T2 and T0 setup
- serial setup
- serial buffering
