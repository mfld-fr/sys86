Highly experimental tiny 8086 system.

Target system is the Advantech SNMP-1000 SBC:
  - R8810 microcontroller (Intel 80188 improved clone)
  - Primary clock @ 20 MHz
  - 512K RAM / 512K Flash
  - Serial port (no FIFO) & 3 timers
  - NE2K compatible Ethernet adapter
  - RTC chip

That target is used to test the code on real & slow HW.
